### About 
This is a website I created for my first ever client. I was asked to both design and write it. I went for a minimalistic, toned-down style suitable for a professional translator.<br/><br/>
As the client asked for a simple website that would inform about the services offered in a clear and easy way, I created a one-page website divided into three sections: information about the types of services offered, a short translator profile, and a contact form.<br/><br/>
I connected the form to the client's email address with Emailjs, using the instructions provided on their website. I finished everything with reCaptcha to protect the e-mail from unnecessary spam.<br/><br/>
Working with reCaptcha was the biggest challenge here, because it was my first time using it and the instructions given in the Google documentation did not work. After some searching/research, I found the NPM library and was able to finally implement the reCaptcha into my code.
